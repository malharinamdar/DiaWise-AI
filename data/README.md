# Dataset

Previous idea was to utilise the existing PIMA diabetes dataset available as the 
prominent dataset. Issue pertaining to that included:

1. lack of data. 768 samples only.
2. low accuracy.
3. high variance resulting due to lack of data.

Hence the chosen dataset was chosen to train the model containing 100000 samples.
