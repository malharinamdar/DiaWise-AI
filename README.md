# Diabetes prediction using machine learning
In this project, our objective is to predict whether a patient has diabetes or not.
The detection is carried our based on parameters which are input by the user like
BMI, insulin level, age, pregnancies(incase of female), glucose, blood pressure 
etc.

In case the patient is tested positive, he/she will be provided personal 
assistance by the use of Generative AI.
