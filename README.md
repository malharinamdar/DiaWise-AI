### Dataset

Previous idea was to utilise the existing PIMA diabetes dataset available as the 
prominent dataset. Issue pertaining to that included:

1. lack of data. 768 samples only.
2. low accuracy.
3. high variance resulting due to lack of data.

Hence the dataset that had important 8 parameters was chosen to train the model containing 100000 samples
achieving an accuracy of 0.94 (or 94%)
