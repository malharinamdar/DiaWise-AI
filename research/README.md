# Understanding Diabetes

General breakdown of food ingested in our body is broken down as glucose by help from insulin secreted by pancreas.

Two things take place in case of diabetes:
1. pancreas does not make enough insulin
2. body's cells resists insulin's effects

### Type 1 diabetes:
Your body attacks insulin-producing cells, so you need medication (insulin) to survive.
### Type 2 diabetes: 
Your body becomes resistant to insulin or doesn't make enough. Often managed with lifestyle changes and/or medication, resulting in 
high blood glucose.
