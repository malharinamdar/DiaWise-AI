# Understanding Diabetes

General breakdown of food ingested in our body is broken down as glucose by help from insulin secreted by pancreas.

Two things take place in case of diabetes:
1. pancreas does not make enough insulin
2. body's cells resists insulin's effects

### Type 1 diabetes:
Your body attacks insulin-producing cells, so you need external supply of medication (insulin) to survive.
### Type 2 diabetes: 
Your body becomes resistant to insulin or doesn't make enough. Often managed with lifestyle changes and/or medication, resulting in 
high blood glucose.

### Deciding Parameters

After analysing a couple of research papers of IEEE, it resulted in deciding the following 8 parameters as our 
inputs upon which the ml model would predict the presence of diabetes in the patients:
1. gender (male or female)
2. age
3. hypertension
4. heart disease
5. smoking history
6. haemoglobin level
7. bmi
8. glucose
